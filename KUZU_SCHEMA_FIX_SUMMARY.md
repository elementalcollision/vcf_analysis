# Kuzu Database Schema Alignment Fix - Summary

## Issue Description
The VCF Analysis Agent load testing framework was encountering Kuzu database schema alignment errors:
```Binder exception: Cannot find property id for s.
```

This error occurred because there were **two different schemas** being created in the same database:
1. **Basic schema** (created by `get_managed_kuzu_connection()`) - Sample nodes with `sample_id` property
2. **Enhanced schema** (created by `create_enhanced_schema()`) - Sample nodes with `id` property

## Root Cause Analysis
- The `get_managed_kuzu_connection()` function was calling `create_schema()` (basic schema)
- The `data_store_manager.py` was calling `create_enhanced_schema()` (enhanced schema)
- Functions like `add_enhanced_sample` expected Sample nodes with `id` property
- But the basic schema created Sample nodes with `sample_id` property
- This caused query failures when trying to access `s.id` on Sample nodes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Schema Unification
**File**: `src/vcf_agent/graph_integration.py`
**Change**: Modified `get_managed_kuzu_connection()` to use enhanced schema instead of basic schema

**Before**:
```python
def get_managed_kuzu_connection() -> kuzu.Connection:
    # ... existing code ...
    create_schema(_kuzu_main_connection)  # ❌ Basic schema
```

**After**:
```python
def get_managed_kuzu_connection() -> kuzu.Connection:
    # ... existing code ...
    create_enhanced_schema(_kuzu_main_connection)  # ✅ Enhanced schema
```

### 2. Unique Variant ID Generation
**File**: `tests/performance/test_load_performance.py`
**Change**: Added timestamp + random suffix to variant IDs to prevent duplicates

**Before**:
```python
variant_id = f"{sample_prefix}_variant_{i}"  # ❌ Could cause duplicates
```

**After**:
```python
timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000)  # milliseconds
random_suffix = random.randint(1000, 9999)
variant_id = f"{sample_prefix}_variant_{timestamp}_{random_suffix}_{i}"  # ✅ Unique
```

### 3. Database Reset
- Removed existing `./kuzu_db` directory to ensure clean schema creation
- All subsequent database operations use the enhanced schema consistently

## Verification Results

### ✅ Schema Consistency Achieved
- All Sample nodes now have `id` property (not `sample_id`)
- All Variant nodes have `id` property
- Enhanced functions work correctly with unified schema

### ✅ Load Testing Working
- Batch processing: ~0.08-0.17s per 50 variants
- Unique variant IDs: No more duplicate key violations
- Relationship creation: HasVariant relationships working properly
- Database operations: All queries executing successfully

### ✅ Performance Metrics
```Adding sample MEMORY_TEST_5 with 50 variants
✅ Added enhanced sample: MEMORY_TEST_5
✅ Added enhanced variant: test_variant_1748450278310_4584_0
✅ Created HasVariant relationship: MEMORY_TEST_5 -> test_variant_1748450278310_4584_0
✅ Batch genomic data insertion completed in 0.08s
```

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Outcomes
1. **Schema Alignment**: ✅ Unified enhanced schema across all operations
2. **Load Testing**: ✅ Framework now fully operational
3. **Data Integrity**: ✅ Unique variant IDs prevent conflicts
4. **Performance**: ✅ Consistent ~0.08-0.17s batch processing times
