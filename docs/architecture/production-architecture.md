## Production Components

### Core Application
- **VCF Agent**: Main AI-powered genomic analysis application
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring with <2s response time
- **Security**: Non-root execution with minimal capabilities

### Observability Stack
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Central telemetry collection and routing
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing with trace visualization
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection with comprehensive alerting
- **Grafana**: Real-time monitoring dashboards with VCF-specific metrics

### Database Layer
- **LanceDB**: Vector similarity search (>95% memory optimized)
- **KuzuDB**: Graph database for relationship analysis

### Infrastructure
- **Docker Containers**: Multi-stage production builds with security hardening
- **Networks**: Isolated application and observability networks
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for databases and logs
- **Secrets**: External file-based secret management

## Security Architecture

### Container Security
```yaml
Security Hardening:
  User: Non-root execution (appuser:1000)
  Filesystem: Read-only with minimal writable mounts
  Capabilities: Dropped ALL, added NET_BIND_SERVICE only
  Networks: Isolated with no unnecessary external access
  Resources: Limited CPU and memory allocation
```

### Network Security
```yaml
Network Isolation:
  app-network: Main application communication
  observability: Monitoring stack communication
  External: Controlled access to AI providers only
  Firewall: Production-ready network policies
```

### Secret Management
```yaml
Secret Configuration:
  Storage: External files with 600 permissions
  Access: Service-specific secret mounting
  Rotation: Support for secret rotation procedures
  Encryption: TLS-ready with certificate management
```

## Performance Architecture

### Memory Optimization
- **>95% Memory Reduction**: From 150MB to 1-3MB per 100 variants
- **Streaming Operations**: Eliminates PyArrow memory bottlenecks  
- **Garbage Collection**: Aggressive cleanup with >90% recovery rate
- **Micro-batching**: Optimized batch sizes for memory efficiency

### Processing Performance
- **Throughput**: 27.6+ variants/second sustained
- **Latency**: <100ms vector search, <500ms graph queries
- **Concurrency**: Multi-threaded with thread-safe operations
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with memory optimization

### Database Performance
```yaml
LanceDB (Vector Store):
  Memory: 1-3MB per 100 variants (98.7% improvement)
  Query Speed: <100ms similarity search
  Optimization: Streaming operations, micro-batching

KuzuDB (Graph Store):
