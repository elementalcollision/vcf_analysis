Agent Integration, Prompt Contracts, and API Usage
===================================================

The VCF Analysis Agent follows robust best practices for agent tool registration, prompt contract usage, and API integration:

- **Tool Registration:** Uses decorators and schemas to register tools with clear input/output definitions. See `src/vcf_agent/agent.py`.
- **Prompt Contracts:** Stores versioned YAML contracts in `prompts/`, each with required fields, schemas, and test cases. See `prompts/README.md`.
- **API Integration & Security:** Employs secure credential management for multiple LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Cerebras). See the main project `README.md` and :doc:`security` for details.
- **Testing & Quality:** Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, E2E, and golden file tests ensuring reliability and regression detection.

Multi-LLM Provider Support
==========================

The agent supports multiple Large Language Model providers for flexible AI integration:

**Supported Providers:**
- **Ollama** (local, open-source; default)
- **OpenAI** (cloud, commercial)  
- **Cerebras** (cloud, specialized)

**Credential Management:**
- Environment variables (.env file)
- JSON credentials file with precedence handling
- Secure API key management and validation

**Usage Examples:**
- ``python -m vcf_agent.cli --model openai ask "Analyze this VCF file"``
- ``python -m vcf_agent.cli --model cerebras ask "Compare these variants"``
- ``python -m vcf_agent.cli --model ollama ask "Validate VCF structure"``

Containerization: Docker, Multi-Arch, and Production Deployment
