## Critical Memory Issues Identified

### 1. LanceDB PyArrow Memory Bottleneck (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: PyArrow operations consume 64.2MiB per batch operation
**Root Cause**: 
- Inefficient data type casting in PyArrow
- Large intermediate data structures during table sanitization
- No memory optimization for batch operations

**Impact**: 
- 60x more memory usage than KuzuDB for equivalent operations
- Primary cause of 1,275MB peak memory usage in load testing
- Prevents scaling beyond 3 concurrent users

### 2. Memory Recovery Failure (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: 0% memory recovery after embedding cleanup
**Root Cause**: 
- Python garbage collection not releasing embedding vectors
- Potential memory leaks in embedding service
- Circular references preventing cleanup

**Impact**: 
- Memory accumulation over time
- Degraded performance in long-running sessions
- Potential out-of-memory errors

### 3. Embedding Memory Accumulation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: 1.4MiB allocated for 30 VCF records with embeddings
**Root Cause**: 
- No embedding caching mechanism
- Synchronous embedding generation
- Large embedding vectors (1536 dimensions)

**Impact**: 
- Linear memory growth with variant count
- Inefficient for batch processing
- Contributes to overall memory pressure

## Remediation Recommendations

### 1. LanceDB Memory Optimization (CRITICAL - Priority 1)

#### A. PyArrow Optimization
```python
# Implement memory-efficient PyArrow operations
def optimize_pyarrow_operations():
    # Use streaming operations instead of batch casting
    # Implement chunked processing for large datasets
    # Optimize data type conversions
    pass
```

#### B. Batch Size Optimization
```python
# Reduce batch sizes to manage memory pressure
OPTIMIZED_BATCH_SIZES = {
    "lancedb_insertion": 25,  # Reduced from 100
    "embedding_generation": 10,  # Reduced from 50
    "dual_database_operations": 15  # Reduced from 25
}
```

#### C. Memory-Aware LanceDB Operations
```python
def memory_aware_lancedb_insert(table, variants, memory_limit_mb=100):
    """Insert variants with memory monitoring"""
    current_memory = get_memory_usage()
    if current_memory > memory_limit_mb:
        gc.collect()  # Force cleanup before operation
    
    # Use streaming insertion for large datasets
    for chunk in chunks(variants, chunk_size=10):
        table.add(chunk)
        if get_memory_usage() > memory_limit_mb:
            gc.collect()
```

### 2. Memory Recovery Implementation (Priority 2)

#### A. Aggressive Garbage Collection
```python
def force_memory_cleanup():
    """Implement aggressive memory cleanup"""
    import gc
    import ctypes
    
    # Multiple GC passes
    for _ in range(3):
        gc.collect()
    
    # Force Python memory cleanup
    if hasattr(ctypes, 'pythonapi'):
        ctypes.pythonapi.PyGC_Collect()
```

#### B. Embedding Cache Management
```python
class ManagedEmbeddingCache:
    def __init__(self, max_memory_mb=50):
        self.cache = {}
        self.max_memory_mb = max_memory_mb
    
    def cleanup_if_needed(self):
        current_memory = get_memory_usage()
        if current_memory > self.max_memory_mb:
            self.cache.clear()
            force_memory_cleanup()
```

### 3. Embedding System Optimization (Priority 3)

#### A. Dimension Reduction
```python
# Reduce embedding dimensions from 1536 to 768
OPTIMIZED_EMBEDDING_CONFIG = {
    "dimensions": 768,  # 50% reduction
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "batch_size": 10
}
```

#### B. Streaming Embedding Generation
```python
async def stream_embedding_generation(texts, batch_size=5):
    """Generate embeddings in memory-efficient streams"""
    for batch in chunks(texts, batch_size):
        embeddings = await generate_embeddings_batch(batch)
        yield embeddings
        # Force cleanup after each batch
        gc.collect()
```

2. **Short-term**: Fix memory recovery issues and implement managed caching
3. **Medium-term**: Optimize embedding system and implement streaming operations

**Expected Outcome**: With these optimizations, the system should achieve <500MB peak memory usage and support 15+ concurrent users.
