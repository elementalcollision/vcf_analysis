## Technical Deep Dive

### Streaming Operations Implementation
```python

    """Memory-optimized variant addition using streaming operations."""
    # Process in 5-variant chunks to minimize PyArrow memory allocation
    for i in range(0, len(variants), chunk_size):
        chunk = variants[i:i + chunk_size]
        with lancedb_write_lock:
            table.add(chunk)  # Minimal memory footprint
        # Aggressive cleanup between chunks
        AggressiveGarbageCollector.cleanup_if_needed(monitor, 100)
```

### Memory Monitoring Integration
```python
with memory_optimized_context("operation_name", memory_limit_mb=100) as monitor:
    # Operation with real-time monitoring
    current_memory = monitor.update_peak()
    if current_memory > limit:
        AggressiveGarbageCollector.force_cleanup()
